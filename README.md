# DL - Leaves Images Classificator
## Description of the problem
This small project was performed as an assignment for the course of _Artificial Neural Networks & Deep Learning_ and it's part of the exam. 
The task was to develop a model for Image Classification and to train it to distinguis between 14 classes of leaves, as in the example below.

## Dataset Description
The dataset we used was composed of 17728 images, but training with only those resulted in a poor accuracy on the private test set. We used the ImageDataGenerator class to perform data augmentation. 

## Final Model
The ultimate model we submitted reached an accuracy of 92.08% on the private test set and was obtained using the technique of _Transfer Learning_; the model was then fine-tuned for two times, with a progressively smaller learning rate.
